# Agile Methodology
* [Agile Methodology](#agile-methodology)

## Overview

I used the project board on GitHub to split all my user stories. I used the GitHub board because it was simple and that was the way I learned through the LMS course. In the beginning, it was really difficult for me with the user stories, but after one day of it, I became more comfortable with it.

For the planning for the project, I split the user stories into diffrent labels, so I could put energy and time on the right things.

Because of the good time I had on this project, I chose to add all of my user stories to one milestone and put that milestone date on 2024-02-25. I focused on finishing the issues on that day. I also realized that it is really challenging to be a one-person agile team.

## Sprint Notes

Below is a summary of learnings from each iteration.

### Sprint 1 notes:

My first sprint was mostly about getting comfortable with the GitHub board and getting the initial apps set up and deployed.

On the first sprint I didn't set any time limit because I started at good time with the project and had alot of time left for the project submission. For me, it was a perfect time to try to understand everything I did and try to do it fluently because I had enough time to go deep in this project.

* 1 User Story was to install Django and supporting libraries
* 2 User Story was to create the Heroku app and attach the database
* 3 User Story was to install Django and supporting libraries
* 4 User Story was to setup Clounddinary and Whitenoise for the static and media files
* 5 User Story was to do the first deployment

### Sprint 2 notes:

My second sprint I was focusing on getting the admin/staff area covered. These user stories were epics and were the most haves for the website.

* EPIC: Manage Store Products
* EPIC: Manage Customer Accounts

### Sprint 3 notes:

My third sprint I was focusing on allow the users to make an account on the website. These were epics user stories.

* EPIC: Account Registration
* EPIC: User Login

### Sprint 4 notes:

In the fourth sprint, I put my focus on getting my bootstrap theme I had chosen taken from start bootstrap. I added the bootstrap and linked the css file that was coming with the theme. Then I focused on getting the all the product and the info for the products to the home page so the users can see them and so on. So, in this sprint I focused on getting the templates right and the bootstrap. I had a good tempo and could also start with the shopping cart and add the functions for that also. 

* Template: Navbar
* Template: Home Page
* Template: Footer
* User Story: Products
* User Story: Cart Update
* User Story: Cart Delete

### Sprint 5 notes:

My fifth sprint I was focusing on the product management for the admin/staff, allowing them to add products, update them and remove them from the store. I also started to write some content for the readme because i was tired of coding and needed to do something else to have the right focus.

* User Story: Product Management
* EPIC: Make Order
* Read Me: Deployment And Development
* Read Me: Intro
* Read Me: Technology Used
* Read Me: Design Choiceso
