* [Agile Methodology](#agile-methodology)

## Overview

I used the project board on GitHub to split all my user stories. I used the GitHub board because it was simple and that was the way I learned through the LMS course. In the beginning, it was really difficult for me with the user stories, but after one day of it, I became more comfortable with it.

For the planning for the project, I split the user stories into diffrent labels, so I could put energy and time on the right things.

## Sprint Notes

Below is a summary of learnings from each iteration.

### Sprint 1 notes:

My first sprint was mostly about getting comfortable with the GitHub board and getting the initial apps set up and deployed.

On the first sprint I didn't set any time limit because I started at good time with the project and had alot of time left for the project submission. For me, it was a perfect time to try to understand everything I did and try to do it fluently because I had enough time to go deep in this project.

* 1 User Story was to install Django and supporting libraries
* 2 User Story was to create the Heroku app and attach the database
* 3 User Story was to install Django and supporting libraries
* 4 User Story was to setup Clounddinary and Whitenoise for the static and media files
* 5 User Story was to do the first deployment

### Sprint 2 notes:

My second sprint I was focusing on getting the admin/staff area covered. These user stories were epics and were the most haves for the website.

* EPIC: Manage Store Products
* EPIC: Manage Customer Accounts

### Sprint 3 notes:

My third sprint I was focusing on allow the users to make an account on the website. These were epics user stories.

* EPIC: Account Registration
* EPIC: User Login

### Sprint 4 notes:

My fourth sprint I was focusing on viewing the products and all the details about them. Allow the user to add/remove product in to the cart and be able to update the quantities of the product. 

* User Story: Products
* User Story: Cart Update
* User Story: Cart Delete

### Sprint 5 notes:

My fifth sprint I was focusing on the product management for the admin/staff, allowing them to add products, update them and remove them from the store. I also started to write some content for the readme because i was tired of coding and needed to do something else to have the right focus.

* User Story: Product Management
