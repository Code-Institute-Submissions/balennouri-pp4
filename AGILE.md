## Overview

For this FastBall project I used agile methodologies to develop it. I used the project board on GitHub to split all my user stories. I used the GitHub board because it was simple and that was the way I learned through the LMS course. In the beginning, it was really difficult for me with the user stories, but after one day of it, I became more comfortable with it.

I started to create detailed features for every task and features required for the project. I organize all the issues and put them into related groups and then in to their epics.

For the milestone, I had a lot of time for this project, so I decided to put all of them in one milestone and add the deadline for the project to 2024-02-25.

For the issues, I used the MoSCoW method (must, should, could, won't) to priotize tasks within each epic.

On the kanban board I had three important columns, with "To do", "In Progress" and "Done". This was good to have because I am always able to look at what is left and what I should do to make effective progress.

While developing the website, I also added three new columns to the kanban board. That was important for me. They were "Epics", "Future" and "Known Bugs and Fixed Bugs". In the first column I added the epic stories. In the second column I added the user stories that I didn't have time to add to the website before the deadline. In the third column I added the bugs and known bugs so I could document them and use them later in the readme.

Now, when I have done a project with agile methodologies and finished it, I also realize that it is really hard to be a one-person agile team.

## Sprint Notes

Below is a summary of learnings from each iteration.

### Sprint 1 notes:

My first sprint was mostly about getting comfortable with the GitHub board and getting the initial apps set up and deployed.

On the first sprint I didn't set any time limit because I started at good time with the project and had alot of time left for the project submission. For me, it was a perfect time to try to understand everything I did and try to do it fluently because I had enough time to go deep in this project.

* 1 User Story was to install Django and supporting libraries
* 2 User Story was to create the Heroku app and attach the database
* 3 User Story was to install Django and supporting libraries
* 4 User Story was to setup Clounddinary and Whitenoise for the static and media files
* 5 User Story was to do the first deployment

### Sprint 2 notes:

### Sprint 4 notes:

In the fourth sprint, I put my focus on getting my bootstrap theme I had chosen taken from start bootstrap. I added the bootstrap and linked the css file that was coming with the theme. Then I focused on getting the all the product and the info for the products to the home page so the users can see them and so on. So, in this sprint I focused on getting the templates right and the bootstrap. I had a good tempo and could also start with the shopping cart and add the functions for that also.

* User Story: Cart Delete

### Sprint 5 notes:

My fifth sprint I was focusing on the product management for the admin/staff, allowing them to add products, update them and remove them from the store. I also started to write some content for the readme because i was tired of coding and needed to do something else to have the right focus.

* User Story: Product Management
* User Story: Comment On Products
* User Story: Make Order
* Read Me: Deployment And Development
* Read Me: Intro
* Read Me: Technology Used
* Read Me: Design Choiceso

### Sprint 6 notes:

My sixth sprint, I focused on getting the info page and the styling for the info page done.

* User Story: Information for users

### Sprint 7 notes:

This sprint was the toughest one because of all of the testing and writing.

* Manual Testing: Delete Account
* Manual Testing: Add/remove products to the cart
